# Initial Price = 65,00,000

# Tenure -> 60 months

# Downpayment % -> Interest Rate %
# 20% -> 17%
# 30% -> 16%
# 40% -> 15%
# 50% -> 13%

# Example 20% Downpayment: 13,00,000

# Remaining Amount = 52,00,000

# Total Interest to Pay = 52,00,000 * 0.17 * 5 -> 44,20,000

# Total Amount to pay monthly = 52,00,000 + 44,20,000 / 60
